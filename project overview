Project overview:
This project uses machine learning and time series forecasting to predict product demand, enabling
optimal restocking decisions. A visual dashboard helps the store owner track inventory health, 
suggested reorder levels, and stock anomalies.

Outcomes:
A time series demand prediction model to forecast product-level sales.
Product-level inventory optimization recommendations(restock, reduce, hold).
An interactive streamlit dashboard to visualize demand trends and stock health.
Admin interface for uploading sales data and downloading optimized inventory reports.
Notifications or indicators for overstock and stockout risks.
